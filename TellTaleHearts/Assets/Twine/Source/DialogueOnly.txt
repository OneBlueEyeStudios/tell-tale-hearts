:: Start
Everything is black. A very faint squeak is heard from an old lantern’s hinge as the flaps are opened to shine a small ray of light. A light that falls upon the one blue eye (One Blue Eye Studios Logo). The eye blinks a few times and a gulp of air is breathed in as the light goes out. In the darkness, all that can be heard is the sounds of a struggle and some muffled screams. It last only a few seconds before fading off. 

It’s still dark, but there is enough light to indicate that we are indoors looking towards the ceiling and wall. The sound of rain can be heard in the far distance with an occasional crack of thunder. Everything is blurry and no detail can be clearly identified. A dark vignette shrouds the out edge of vision and pulses everytime the sound of heart beats. The logo for the game dissolves in like smoke forming in the center of the screen. 

The logo dissolves away and the camera pans down until it is looking straight ahead and everything comes into focus. The sound of the heart fades away into nothingness. The rain becomes slightly louder and clearer.
