basically finished:
-rain (intensity: thunder 5-10)
-room tone
-stove (door: 4-7 open, 7-10 close) (it starts as closed, and you have to open it before you want to close it. I don’t know what will happen if you directly jump from 0 to 10. I think it will open first then close.)
-footstep (surface: 0-1 silent, 1-2 rug, 2-3 wood, 3-4 creaky rug)
-footstep-cop1 (surface: 0-1 silent, 1-2 rug, 2-3 wood, 3-4 creaky flr)
-footstep-cop2 (surface: 0-1 silent, 1-2 rug, 2-3 wood, 3-4 creaky flr)

not good enough:
-door (door: 5 initial 0-1 open, 9-10 close)
-heartbeat (speed: 0-1 silent, 1-3 normal, 3-5 fast, 5-7 super fast, 7-10 silent)
-breath (frequency: 0-2 silent, 2-5 deep, 5-10 fast)
